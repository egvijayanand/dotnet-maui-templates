Templates updated to support .NET 10 Preview 2.

To facilitate this, within the Project Options page in the IDE, this Application Design option is available as a dropdown UI control. Select JSHybrid as its value.

Since HybridWebView is a feature introduced in .NET MAUI 9, creating a .NET MAUI 8 App with this value of JSHybrid will NOT result in an error; instead, it will fall back by creating a App project that corresponds to the default Plain value.
