Join me on Developer Thoughts (https://egvijayanand.in/), an exclusive blog for articles on .NET MAUI and Blazor.

What's new in ver. 3.2.0-preview.6:
-----------------------------------
With support for StartPath property while creating the BlazorWebView item templates on .NET 8.

Note: Restore the project before making use of the item template.

v3.2.0-preview.5:

An item template for BlazorWebView in XAML and C#.

Note: While working with .NET 7 or higher SDK, the namespace parameter in short notation needs to be passed as -p:na (i.e., it needs to be prefixed with -p:).

dotnet new maui-bwv -n HomePage -na MyApp.Views

dotnet new maui-bwv-cs -n HomePage -na MyApp.Views

On .NET 7 or later:

dotnet new maui-bwv -n HomePage -p:na MyApp.Views

dotnet new maui-bwv-cs -n HomePage -p:na MyApp.Views

v3.2.0-preview.4:

Conditionally defined supported platforms properties based on the target platform opted-in.

v3.2.0-preview.3:

1. While targeting .NET 8, the StartPath property is set to load a Razor component other than the one defined with the default route address of '/'

2. A change in the navigation menu style for better interop

v3.2.0-preview.2:

1. Fixed the issue #124 - The project node is not closed properly in the solution file while creating a Blazor Hybrid with the RCL option from CLI.

2. Stability improvements that extend the list of copy-only binary files.

v3.2.0-preview.1:

While creating a Blazor Hybrid App, an option to abstract the Razor components as a separate Razor class library.

-rcl | --razor-class-library - Default value is false

dotnet new mauiapp -n MyApp -dp Hybrid -rcl
(or)
dotnet new mauiapp --name MyApp --design-pattern Hybrid --razor-class-library

v3.1.0:

All the preview features have reached stable.

v3.1.0-preview.9:

1. Introduced an item template to generate Page and its ViewModel in a single command, available for both XAML and C#.

The Page will be generated in the Views folder and ViewModel will be generated in the ViewModels folder.

Can also be overridden to generate in the same folder with the -sf | --same-folder option.

The ViewModels are generated with the base class titled BaseViewModel (implementation left to the user).

Recommended to add CommunityToolkit.Mvvm, an officially supported NuGet package, to make it easy to work with MVVM design pattern.

Since it makes use of the .NET 7 SDK feature of auto namespace resolution, so restore the project before executing the commands.

Note: Don't suffix anything to the name, it'll be included automatically.

dotnet new maui-mvvm -n Login

dotnet new maui-mvvm-cs -n Login

Output structure:

XAML:

ViewModels
    LoginViewModel.cs
Views
    LoginPage.xaml
    LoginPage.xaml.cs

C#:

ViewModels
    LoginViewModel.cs
Views
    LoginPage.cs

v3.1.0-preview.8:

1. Added the option to use Compiled Bindings option while using the MVVM option. This will make use of the x:Bind extension instead of the Binding extension.

-icb | --include-compiled-bindings - Default value is false.

dotnet new mauiapp -n MyApp -mvvm -icb

Note: When the MVVM option is not opted-in, selecting this compiled binding option will include only the NuGet package reference.

v3.1.0-preview.7:

1. Added the option to create a .NET MAUI App with the MVU pattern using Reactor.

To facilitate this, the design-pattern parameter now takes the option of Reactor.

dotnet new mauiapp -o MyApp -dp Reactor

Note: MVVM option won't have any impact on the App created with Reactor option as it is based on the MVU design pattern.

v3.1.0-preview.6:

1. Now MVVM option works with an App created with a Hybrid design pattern also.

dotnet new mauiapp -o MyApp -dp Hybrid -mvvm

2. Added the option to create a .NET MAUI App with the MVU pattern using Comet.

To facilitate this, the design-pattern parameter now takes the option of Comet.

dotnet new mauiapp -o MyApp -dp Comet

Since this Comet is still in the PoC stage and no published roadmap for future updates. So, try it at your own risk.

Note: MVVM option won't have any impact on the App created with Comet option as it is based on the MVU design pattern.

v3.1.0-preview.5:

1. MVVM is a delightful and development-friendly design pattern to work with. To support this, a new parameter has been introduced:

-mvvm | --use-mvvm and its default value is false.

XAML with MVVM:

dotnet new mauiapp -o MyApp -mvvm

C# Markup with MVVM:

dotnet new mauiapp -o MyApp -dp Markup -mvvm

To work with .NET 8 Previews: specify the framework parameter and its value: -f net8.0

Note: Opting for this MVVM option will not have any impact on the Web-based AppModels such as Blazor syntax (Hybrid) / Razor syntax.

v3.1.0-preview.4:

1. Added the option to create a .NET MAUI App using C# Markup syntax with CommunityToolkit.Maui.Markup NuGet package.

To facilitate this, the design-pattern parameter now takes the option of Markup.

dotnet new mauiapp -o MarkupApp -dp Markup

dotnet new mauiapp -o MarkupApp -f net8.0 -dp Markup

v3.1.0-preview.3:

1. Fixed the build issue (#109) of the .NET MAUI class library with .NET MAUI Essentials targeting the Windows platform.

2. Added the option to create a .NET MAUI App using Razor syntax with BlazorBindings.Maui NuGet package.

To facilitate this, the design-pattern parameter now takes the option of Razor.

dotnet new mauiapp -o BlazorBindings -dp Razor

dotnet new mauiapp -o BlazorBindings -f net8.0 -dp Razor

3. Item templates for .NET MAUI ContentPage, ContentView, and ShellPage using Razor syntax.

dotnet new maui-page-razor -n SearchPage

dotnet new maui-view-razor -n OrderView

dotnet new maui-shell-razor -n AppShell

4. Ability to set the access modifier (--access-modifier | --am) while creating a C# class from CLI.

The default value is public.

dotnet new class-cs -n Routes -am internal

v3.1.0-preview.2:

1. .NET MAUI App and Library project framework targets were restructured to better align with the development/build platforms.

This enables to make use of the template without any modification across OS such as Windows, macOS, and Linux.

2. .NET MAUI Class Library can be created target .NET MAUI Essentials.

Parameter name: --use-maui-essentials | -ume

3. While targeting .NET 8 Preview, the Tizen platform target is commented out in the project file as a public preview of the Tizen workload is yet to be made available.

This will be re-enabled once the workload is made available.

Examples:

With default values, below command creates a library project for .NET 7 with Target Platform set to All.

dotnet new mauiclasslib -o MyLib -ume

Below command creates a library project for .NET 8 with Target Platform set to Mobile (iOS and Android) and .NET 8 (Base framework).

dotnet new mauiclasslib -f net8.0 -o MyLib -ume -tp Mobile Base

v3.1.0-preview.1:

1. Similar to the All-in-One .NET MAUI App, the Class Library project template also takes target-platform as a parameter that takes a combination of the following values (with All being the default value).

All      Targets all possible .NET MAUI-supported platforms.
Base     Targets base framework (.NET 6/7/8) based on the framework selected.
Android  Targets Android platform.
iOS      Targets iOS platform.
macOS    Targets macOS platform via Mac Catalyst.
Windows  Targets Windows platform via WinUI 3.
Tizen    Targets Tizen platform.
Mobile   Targets Android and iOS platforms.
Desktop  Targets Windows and macOS platforms.
Apple    Targets iOS and macOS platforms.

2. .NET MAUI Class Library can be created target .NET Razor SDK.

Parameter name: --use-razor-sdk | -usr

3. .NET MAUI Class Library can be created target .NET MAUI Core.

Parameter name: --use-maui-core | -umc

Note: .NET MAUI Essentials is a transitive dependency to .NET MAUI Core.

Examples:

With default values, below command creates a library project for .NET 7 with Target Platform set to All.

dotnet new mauiclasslib -o MyLib -urs -umc

Below command creates a library project for .NET 8 with Target Platform set to Mobile (iOS and Android) and .NET 8 (Base framework).

dotnet new mauiclasslib -f net8.0 -o MyLib -urs -umc -tp Mobile Base

v3.0.2:

Fix for https://github.com/egvijayanand/dotnet-maui-templates/issues/110

v3.0.1:

1. Additional parameters added to the Partial Class (class-cs) item template.

Opting out of partial feature:

dotnet new class-cs OrderDataStore -b IDataStore -p false

2. Dependent packages have been updated to their latest versions.

v3.0.0:

Templates updated for .NET 8 Preview 1.

Supported values for target framework parameter, can be specified with --framework / -f

net6.0
net7.0 (the default value)
net8.0

Note:

Auto binding the project's RootNamespace as the namespace for newly created class type is supported only on .NET 7 SDK or later.

While running on earlier SDK versions, it has to be manually modified.

And due to the limitation in the templating engine, only the RootNamespace would get added, need to manually adjust for sub-folders, if any.
