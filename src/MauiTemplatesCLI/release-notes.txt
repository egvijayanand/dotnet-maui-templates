What's new in ver. 8.3.0:
-------------------------
Templates updated to support .NET MAUI 10 SR4.

v8.2.0:

Templates updated to support .NET MAUI 10 SR3.

For MCL, MauiProgram.cs file is retained in the head project to handle platform-specific configurations.

And its extension is in the MCL to manage the shared configuration.

v8.1.0:

Templates updated to support .NET MAUI 10 SR2.

v8.0.0:

1. Templates updated to support .NET MAUI 10 Stable channel release.

2. The Framework parameter now defaults to net10.0 in all project templates.

By default, the project command creates a .NET MAUI 10 project.

dotnet new mauiapp -o MyApp

When creating a .NET 8 or 9 project, an explicit value for the Framework parameter is required.

dotnet new mauiapp -o MyApp -f net9.0

3. By default, the solution file is created in the new SLNX format.

To work with the classic SLN format, override the default value.

dotnet new mauiapp -o MyApp -slnx:false

4. Introduced an option for .NET MAUI 10 Source Generation feature to improve Debug build performance.

-sg | --source-gen - Default value is false

dotnet new mauiapp -o MyApp -sg

5. Introduced an item template to support the new .NET 10 file-based apps.

It's named fileapp, and it requires a filename without an extension as its input.

Optionally, it accept the following parameters:

--sdk - .NET supported SDKs, in short notation.

Supported values are: Aspire, BlazorWasm, Razor, Web, Worker

--maui - To be used with Aspire SDK for .NET MAUI integration

--preview - To use the language preview features

dotnet new fileapp -n Aspire --sdk Aspire --maui

dotnet new fileapp -n Console

dotnet new fileapp -n MyApp --sdk Web

v7.13.0:

The UI text has been updated to reflect Aspire integration support for earlier versions too.

In the next version, the default Framework value will be updated to net10.0 to support .NET 10.

v7.12.0:

Aspire integration is no longer limited to being a .NET MAUI 10 exclusive feature.

Yes, it’s now accessible for older versions as well.

dotnet new mauiapp -o MyApp --aspire

v7.11.0:

Introduced an option to integrate .NET MAUI 10 with Aspire.

--aspire - Default value is false.

dotnet new mauiapp -o MyApp -f net10.0 --aspire

This will generate two more projects: one for Aspire AppHost and another for Service Defaults.

The Aspire AppHost project will reference the .NET MAUI project, while the .NET MAUI project will reference the Service Defaults project.

Note: This feature is exclusive to .NET MAUI 10 and does not apply to other versions.

Global namespace is the default option for .NET MAUI 10, but for smooth migration and to test backward compatibility, it can be opted out.

dotnet new mauiapp -o MyApp -gn:false -f net10.0

The MauiVersion can now be shown on any page, thanks to its refactoring into a control template.

App project template revised to utilize the integrated app hosting builder method for startup.

For more details, consult this article.

https://egvijayanand.in/2025/09/29/integrated-app-hosting-builder-method-for-dotnet-maui-explained/

For app projects targeting .NET MAUI 9 and above, the Tall TitleBar is configured.

Alternatively, update the MainWindow type to a prebuilt Window type in the unified App startup within MauiProgram.cs.

v7.9.1:

Fix release.

v7.9.0:

Templates updated to support .NET MAUI 10 RC1 and .NET MAUI 9 SR11.

When targeting .NET MAUI 10, all XAML files in XAML-based projects will be generated using the .NET MAUI 10 Global namespace.

Refer to the Imports.cs source file for XML namespace definitions.

All XAML Item Templates now include support for two optional parameters, as outlined below.

-gn | --global-namespace - Default value is false

v7.0.0:

1. Support for creating .NET MAUI projects on .NET 10 Previews.

For this, have introduced an additional option to the framework parameter - net10.0

Note: The default value for the framework parameter remains as net9.0, which means to create a project for .NET MAUI 10, an explicit value of net10.0 is to be passed.

dotnet new mauiapp -o MyApp -f net10.0

2. On the stable channel, the value of the MauiVersion property is bumped to 9.0.40 to support the latest version of .NET MAUI 9 SR4 NuGet packages.

Known issue: The hybrid solution with MAUI and Razor components, abstracted as a separate library, is experiencing build issues in .NET 10 Preview 1.

v6.1.0:

Introduced an option to create a new project template using HybridWebView.

To know more about this, consult this article https://egvijayanand.in/2024/10/04/exploring-dotnet-maui-9-hybridwebview-features/

To facilitate this, the design pattern (-dp) parameter includes a new value called JSHybrid, which creates an App project using HybridWebView with all prerequisites set automatically, requiring no manual intervention.

In the VS2022/Rider IDE, within the Project Options page, this Design Pattern is available as a dropdown UI control. Select JSHybrid as its value.

.NET MAUI 9 App using HybridWebView:

dotnet new mauiapp -o MyApp -dp JSHybrid

Since HybridWebView is a feature introduced in .NET MAUI 9, creating a .NET MAUI 8 App with this design pattern (-dp) parameter value of JSHybrid will not result in an error; instead, it will fall back by creating a App project that corresponds to the default Plain value.

Note: The design pattern (-dp) parameter with the value Hybrid will continue to generate an App project using BlazorWebView, which works on both .NET MAUI 8 and 9, the present stable channel release.

dotnet new mauiapp -o BlazorApp -dp Hybrid

The CommunityToolkit.Maui.Markup Toolkit NuGet package version has been updated to v5.1.0, targeting the .NET 9 release.

v6.0.0:

Templates updated to support .NET MAUI 9 Stable channel release.

The default value for the Framework parameter is now set to net9.0

dotnet new mauiapp -o MyApp

To create a .NET MAUI 8 project, explicitly pass the Framework parameter value.

dotnet new mauiapp -o MyApp -f net8.0

Added support for Dynamic NuGet package versioning for .NET MAUI 9 (similar to that in .NET MAUI 8)

Removed unsupported versions (.NET MAUI 6 and 7) and Comet, as it is no longer being updated.

For ease of work, the MAUI CommunityToolkit and Syncfusion MAUI Toolkit's XAML namespaces have been added to App.xaml file, if opted.

Support for Nightly build configuration has been added for .NET MAUI 9 also.

dotnet new mauiapp -o MyApp -ni

Wherever applicable, .NET MAUI 9 constructs are applied, such as referencing the Window Page instead of the Application MainPage.

v5.15.0:

Introduced the option to add and configure the Syncfusion.Maui.Toolkit NuGet package.

Note: This would be an explicit option.

dotnet new mauiapp -o MyApp -slnx

2. Defined an item template to generate the slnx solution file from the CLI.

dotnet new slnx

v5.10.1:

The value of MauiVersion property has been updated to version 8.0.71 to represent the most recent minor service release, .NET MAUI 8 SR7.1.

Templates updated for .NET 9 Preview 5.

v5.5.0:

Introduced an option to abstract the Shared components as a separate .NET MAUI Class Library

This will create a solution structure that is akin to Xamarin.Forms (the only difference is that there won't be multiple head projects)

dotnet new maui-view-cs -n Order

Output: OrderView.cs

2. A revolutionary generic template, in XAML and C#, for creating items of any type.

And it is named as: maui-item and maui-item-cs

Both need one required parameter, -b / --base, the base type.

Optionally takes another parameter, -g / --generic, to specify the generic base type.

In addition, the XAML template takes one more parameter, -xo / --xaml-only, when defined, generates only XAML definition.

Note: Namespace resolution in both XAML and C# file is left to the user as deriving them with the template is outside its scope.

Example:

dotnet new maui-item -n HomePage -b ContentPage

Output: HomePage.xaml and HomePage.xaml.cs

public partial class HomePage : ContentPage {}

dotnet new maui-item -n SearchPage -b MauiPage -g SearchViewModel

Output: SearchPage.xaml and SearchPage.xaml.cs
